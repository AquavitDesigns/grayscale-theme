Grayscale Jekyll theme
=========================

This is a Jekyll theme forked from the original Grayscale theme by [ Start Bootstrap ](http://startbootstrap.com
) under these [ license terms ](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/grayscale-theme/blob/master/LICENCE). 

This [ link ](http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-grayscale/) to Iron Summit Media is a dead end. If I am connecting the dots correctly - that link would be superceded by this link [Start Bootstrap Grayscale Theme from Blackrock Digital ](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-grayscale)

Many of the free themes referenced by [ JekyllThemes.org ](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/grayscale/) appear to have been produced by [ Start Bootstrap ](http://startbootstrap.com) and their site would be worth a close look for both free and premium BootStrap themes.

## Photo Copyright

The photo in my repository fork is Copyright (c) John Weston 2016, All Rights Reserved.

If you would happen to fork or clone the repository - I will make the same request that was stated in one of the original Grayscale theme files. Please remove and replace with your own or actual Creative Commons images - consider this image a proprietary design asset. I took the picture about a decade ago with an old Canon Elph and applied a filter using Aperture for use on this site. The filter was needed to help the text stand out - just like the original theme authors did with their background images. In short - don't steal and use the photo.
