                <h2>Aquavit Designs: Background</h2>
                <p>As some history and background - I originally explored development on Apple platforms in the early 1990s when I had a PowerBook. I sold that PowerBook to a journalist traveling to Africa which seemed like a good way to pay it forward. Time passed and after I purchased my 17 inch Mac Book Pro around 2010 - I revisited development for OSX and iOS as independent study but also coding up tools and apps for OSX or iOS that I actually needed. That initial work was in Objective-C (and C++) on OSX and iOS and it was good to be back in a Unix shell in the OSX and iOS toolchain.</p>
                <p>I was a lucky enough to get one of the Golden Tickets to WWDC in 2014 - so since then - work also included building up skills in Swift with an accelerated level of productivity as the tools and language has been settling. My focus has been on the native Apple Frameworks i.e. not using C# middleware such as Xamarin. I have also explored JavaScript - mostly in the context of hybrid mobile and desktop application development using enablers such as Ionic, Angular, the Electron substrate (e.g. inside Atom) and TypeScript.</p>
                <p>As an output of many iterative development spikes, I have been releasing selected source code as open source under MIT License. In addition to mobile platform work (largely iOS) some recent work has focused on incorporating cloud connected devices. The cloud experiments have been in the context of remote monitoring for homebrewing or other smart home solutions that involve remote sensing such as with the Particle device family or my NVIDIA Jetson board.</p>
                <p>Feel free to reach out - I am always open to connect with other builders and makers whether it involves code, hardware or other media.</p>
